**Influence of OPEC on World Oil Prices**

**Overview:**
This repository includes the final research paper "Influence of OPEC on World Oil Prices." 
The paper examines the extent of OPEC's influence on global oil prices from 1961 to 2020, focusing on significant events like the oil crises of 1973 and 1979, and the strategic role of Saudi Arabia within OPEC.

**Key Objectives:**
- Evaluating OPEC’s Role as a Cartel: Investigates the cohesiveness of OPEC countries in influencing oil production and reserves, using correlation and regression analyses.
- Oil Shocks Analysis: Examines the 1973 and 1979 oil shocks, assessing the impact of OPEC's policies and production practices on global oil prices.
- Saudi Arabia's Influence: Analyzes Saudi Arabia’s transition from a swing producer to a "tit-for-tat" strategy after 1985, demonstrating its dominant role in oil price manipulation.

**Methodology:**
- Data Collection: Used historical data from 12 countries (six OPEC and six non-OPEC) on crude oil production and reserves, spanning 60 years.
- Analytical Tools: Descriptive and inferential statistics, including regression and correlation tests, were employed to evaluate OPEC’s production and price influence. Key events were analyzed theoretically to understand their economic and political impact.

**Findings:**
- OPEC’s Limited Cohesion: Findings suggest that OPEC members often do not act cohesively as a cartel, with significant deviations from production quotas.
- Oil Crises Impact: OPEC’s influence on the oil crises of the 1970s appears to be limited, with weak correlation observed between OPEC's production and global oil prices.
- Role of Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia plays a critical role in stabilizing oil prices and market share, primarily through production adjustments in response to other OPEC members' overproduction.
